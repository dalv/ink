Main App:
- Get the main page going: story, inventory, options
- Cookie save user progress
- Breadcrumb save

Dashboard:
- Dashboard page sometimes jumps to the top after an edit - fix this
- Would be nice to have pagination on dashboard page: show 10/20/30 items at one time with "next" "prev" buttons
- We need some loading animation for when angular does data binding - for both dashboard and main app - right now it just seems frozen
X Deleted options are not getting deleted form the db - orphaned options ar piling up
- Exhaustible needs to be aware of which options are gone and show new options accordingly
